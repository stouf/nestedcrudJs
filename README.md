# nestedcrud

*(Work in progress !!)*

The goal of this small lib is to let developers being able to get access to object's properties like the following:

```javascript
var nestedcrud = require('nestedcrud');

var object = {
		name: 'stouf',
		companies: {
			main: {
				name: 'Wizcorp',
				country: 'Japan'
			}
		}
	};

nestedcrud.get(object, 'companies.main.name');  // "Wizcorp"

nestedcrud.set(object, 'companies.main.city', 'Japan');
nestedcrud.get(object, 'companies.main.city');	// "Japan"

nestedcrud.del(object, 'companies.main.name');
nestedcrud.del(object, 'companies.main.country');
// object = { name: 'stouf' }
// The lib deletes empty objects generated by the last deletion
```

The basic CRUD operations (`get`, `set` `delete`) will be implemented.

## API


### `get(object, path)`

- *object* is your targeted object
- *path* is the accessor (i.e `subObject1.subObject2.property`)


### `set(object, path, value, override)`

- *object* is your targeted object
- *path* is the accessor (i.e `subObject1.subObject2.property`)
- *value* is whatever you want to save in `object`
- *override* is an optional boolean (default: false) which tells whether an existing value should be overriden if
   encounters


### `del(object, path, cleanup)`

- *object* is your targeted object
- *path* is the accessor (i.e `subObject1.subObject2.property`)
- *cleanup* is an optional boolean (default: true) telling whether empty objects should be deleted at the end of the
  deletion or not.
